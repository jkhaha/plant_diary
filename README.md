# Plant Diary

Plant Diary is designed to keep track of your house plants. Users can create an account and submit information about each plant, including its species, location in home, description and watering schedule. Users have the ability to create, update, delete, and write diary entries about each plant. Each user's homepage also contains a to-do list so individuals can keep track of plant related tasks and check off each task once completed. 

## Motivation

This application is made for plant lovers who have a difficult time keeping track of all the plants in their home.
